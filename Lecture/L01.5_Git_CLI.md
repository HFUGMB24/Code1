## Git Command Line

The Git CLI (Command Line Interface) client is the base implementation of Git, while also being the most powerful. Most of the terminology you learned so far is a base concept of a CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) and/or it being a git command. Most Git CLI commands are just named after the CVS concept and sometimes even have easier to remember/type shortcuts (e.g. `git add` is synonymous `git stage`). So if you can verbalize the thing you want to do in proper CVS lingo, you can most likely also know the Git CLI command you need. Since Git repositories are UI agnostic, you can always mix in a bit of CLI usage. For a small change typing an *add-commit-push* is always faster than starting any bulky GUI client. There is also advanced functionality (*git plumbing*, you will likely never need it) that is only implemented by the Git CLI because it is near impossible to graphically represent it.

Using the Git CLI, at least for a bit, helps learning and understanding the Git and CVS basics.

### Optional Assignments

Obviously do this in the CLI!

- Create a new Git repository locally on your machine.
- Do *add*, *commit*, *branch*, *merge*.
- Push it to a new GitHub repository.
- How do you jump to a specific commit?
