# L01_Git

## Git in Visual Studio Code

- *Clone* your Code1 repository to your local computer.
- Change something locally and *push* the changes back to GitHub.
- Discuss how the concepts of *Repository*, *Commit*, *Branch* and *Remote* are connected to each other.
- Familiarize yourself with the following Git actions: *stage*, *commit*, *fetch*, *pull*, *push*, *merge*.
- Create a new *branch* and change something. Switch back to your main *branch* and change something else. Now *merge* your new *branch* back into your main branch.
